# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##Analyizing Kickstarter Data to Help Louise Launch a Successful Play Fundraising Campaign
###Louise began a fundraising campagin for her play, Fever, and came close to successfully funding the goal, but came short. She would like to know how other campaigns faired compared to hers. We utilized the Kickstarter data to analyze the factors that made previous plays successful vs failed vs canceled. We preformed several different searches to find the relevant data to theater, specificallly play productions. With these narrowed down datasets, we analyzed the different campaign goals, pledges, outcomes, start and end dates. This, along with statstical calculations such as measures of central tendancy and spread, allowed us to provide Louise with some background as to what campaign funding goals and what times of year are most successful for a campaign launch. 
###When filtering the play campaign data by the launch date, we were able to find that a higher number of campaigns were successfully funded during the summer months (May to July). Campaigns started early in the year had a higher number of successful vs failed campaigns, but no significant difference in ratios until May. Campaigns started later in the year, specifically December, were hit or miss on making their campaign goal, with 37 successful, 35 failed campaigns, and 3 canceled campaigns. See the theater outcomes based on launch date chart below.

###When analyizing the outcomes based on the campaign goal, we were able to find that the smaller the campaign goal (<$4999), the more likely the campaign was to succeed. The higher the campaign goal (>$5000), the less conclusive the data became. Goals ranging from $5000 to $24,999 were almost 50/50% successful vs failed. Goals ranging from $25000 to $34999 had higher failure percentage but goals from $35000 to $44999 had higher success percentages. One campaign with a goal in the $45000 to $50000 range succeeded, but a very small percentage (17%) of goals above $50000 succeeded. No play production campgains were canceled.
