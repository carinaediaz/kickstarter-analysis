# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of the Project
### Analyizing kickstarter data to help Louise launch a successful play fundraising campaign
## Purpose
### Louise began a fundraising campagin for her play, Fever, and came close to successfully funding the goal, but came short. She would like to know how other campaigns faired compared to hers. We utilized the Kickstarter data to analyze the factors that made previous plays successful vs failed vs canceled. We preformed several different searches to find the relevant data to theater, specificallly play productions. With these narrowed down datasets, we analyzed the different campaign goals, pledges, outcomes, start and end dates. This, along with statstical calculations such as measures of central tendancy and spread, allowed us to provide Louise with some background as to what campaign funding goals and what times of year are most successful for a campaign launch. 
## Analysis of Outcomes and Challenges
### When filtering the play campaign data by the launch date, we were able to find that a higher number of campaigns were successfully funded during the summer months (May to August). Campaigns started early in the year had a higher number of successful vs failed campaigns, but no significant difference in ratios until May. Campaigns started later in the year, specifically December, were hit or miss on making their campaign goal, with 37 successful, 35 failed campaigns, and 3 canceled campaigns. Challenges that could be faced in making assumptions that campaigns are more likely to the successful in meeting their goal if it is launches in the summer months should not be made solely off of this analysis, as correlation does not imply causation. See the theater outcomes based on launch date line graph below.

### When analyizing the outcomes based on the campaign goal, we were able to find that the smaller the campaign goal (<$4999), the more likely the campaign was to succeed. The higher the campaign goal (>$5000), the less conclusive the data became. Goals ranging from $5000 to $24,999 were almost 50/50% successful vs failed. Goals ranging from $25000 to $34999 had higher failure percentage but goals from $35000 to $44999 had higher success percentages. One campaign with a goal in the $45000 to $50000 range succeeded, but a very small percentage (17%) of goals above $50000 succeeded. No play production campgains were canceled.

## Results
### It can be concluded that to have the best odds of a successfully funded campaign for a play preduction, based on the findings in our analysis, that Louise should have a campagain with a launch date in the summer months and a goal below $5000. While we stated that correlation does not imply causation, the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph shows that campaigns launched in May through August had a higher success rate than those started in other months. To further prepare Louise for a successful campaign, we can refer to the Outcome Based on Goal graph that shows the highest success rate being for play proudctions with goals under $5000. Overall, based on our Kickstarter dataset, there is an almost 50-50 percent chance of a play production campaign being successfully funded, but we want our client to be set up for a successful campagain. It is because of this that we recommend a summer launch date and a campagain goal of less than $5000. 
### There are limitations to the conclusions that can be made on this data,
