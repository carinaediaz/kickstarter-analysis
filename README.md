# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of the Project
##### Analyizing kickstarter data to help Louise launch a successful play fundraising campaign
## Purpose
##### Louise began a fundraising campagin for her play, Fever, and came close to successfully funding the goal, but came short. She would like to know how other campaigns faired compared to hers. We utilized Kickstarter data to analyze the factors that made previous plays successful vs failed vs canceled. We preformed several different searches to find the relevant data to theater, specificallly play productions. With these narrowed down datasets, we analyzed the different campaign goals, pledges, outcomes, start and end dates. This, along with statstical calculations such as measures of central tendancy and spread, allowed us to provide Louise with some background as to what campaign funding goals and what times of year are most successful for a campaign launch. 
## Analysis of Outcomes and Challenges
### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
##### When filtering the play campaign data by the launch date, we were able to find that a higher number of campaigns were successfully funded during the summer months (May to August). Campaigns started early in the year had a higher number of successful vs failed campaigns, but the ratio significantly increases in May. Campaigns started later in the year, specifically December, were hit or miss on making their campaign goal, with 37 successful, 35 failed campaigns, and 3 canceled campaigns. Challenges that could be faced in making assumptions that campaigns are more likely to the successful in meeting their goal if it is launches in the summer months should not be made solely off of this analysis, as correlation does not imply causation. See the theater outcomes based on launch date line graph below.

### Campaign Goals and Outcomes
##### When analyizing the outcomes based on the campaign goal, we were able to find that the smaller the campaign goal (<$4,999), the more likely the campaign was to succeed. The higher the campaign goal (>$5,000), the less conclusive the data became. Goals ranging from $5,000 to $24,999 were almost 50/50% successful vs failed. Goals ranging from $25,000 to $34,999 had higher failure percentage but goals from $35,000 to $44,999 had higher success percentages. One campaign with a goal in the $45,000 to $50,000 range succeeded, but a very small percentage (17%) of goals above $50,000 succeeded. No play production campgains were canceled.

## Results
###### It can be concluded that to have the best odds of a successfully funded campaign for a play preduction, based on the findings in our analysis, that Louise should have a campagain with a launch date in the summer months and a goal below $5,000. While we should not assume that a campaign launched in May will be successful solely off of the Kickstarter data, we identified a trend that could be beneficial to Louise's campaign. The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph helps visualize that campaigns launched in May through August had a higher success rate than those started in other months. To further prepare Louise for a successful campaign, we can refer to the Outcome Based on Goal graph that shows the highest success rate being for play proudctions with goals under $5,000. While plays with goals between $5,000 - $20,000 had a 50% or higher success rate, plays with goals less than $5,000 had over 70% success in meeting their goals.
## Limitations
##### There are limitations to the conclusions that can be made on this data. We must frame our analysis in the context that we only collected data on campaigns hosted on the Kickstarter platform, while there are many other fundraising platforms such as GoFundMe, Patreon, and Wefunder. A trend we found in Kickstarter campaigns may not be the same across all fundraising platforms. Another limitation is that we framed our analysis in the context of data for all countries, not just the country in which Louise would like to host her play. We could produce an outcomes vs goals line graph, similar to the one above, but filtered to only show US play campaigns to see if there are any differences worldwide vs US.
